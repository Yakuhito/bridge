### Prize Pot

A public prize pot is kept at `xch1z7858gvuwpm9tsqdevaf9nemvmragszhv76tpe3v7q9awhl8uyaqc47p9q` ([SpaceScan](https://www.spacescan.io/address/xch1z7858gvuwpm9tsqdevaf9nemvmragszhv76tpe3v7q9awhl8uyaqc47p9q); [XCHScan](https://xchscan.com/address/xch1z7858gvuwpm9tsqdevaf9nemvmragszhv76tpe3v7q9awhl8uyaqc47p9q)). We reserve the right to decide whether a vulnerability report should be awarded or not, as well as the exact amount to be awarded on a case-by-case basis.

Generally, we will award critical issues that would break the protocol or the bridge apps contained in this repository. For example, it's likely that a vulnerability that allows someone to unlock (unwrap) more XCH than they are supposed to will receive a bounty. Likewise, an issue that allows a message to be relayed twice will also (most probably) be awarded.

Scope:
 * Chialisp in this repository (for the cross-chain messaging protocol, as well as for the two bridges)
 * Validator code
 * Solidity code (only after 1st audit is announced and finished)
